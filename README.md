# 🚀 Keep Me Online 🟢

## 👀 Overview
**Keep Me Online** is a Python-based UI application that prevents online inactivity detection by simulating user input. The tool can periodically move the mouse cursor or send a keyboard input (such as the **Shift** key) to keep the session active.

The app is available as an executable (`.exe`), ready to use without installation.
